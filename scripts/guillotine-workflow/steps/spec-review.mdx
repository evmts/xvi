SPEC COMPLIANCE REVIEW — Ticket: {props.ticketId}

Title: {props.ticketTitle}
Category: {props.ticketCategory}

You are reviewing this ticket's implementation for **spec compliance only**.
You are NOT reviewing code quality — that's a separate review.

## Review Checklist

READ every file modified/created. For each, verify:

1. **Execution-specs compliance** — Read the relevant Python code in execution-specs/ and compare line-by-line
   - Gas calculations match exactly
   - State transitions match exactly
   - Error conditions match exactly
   - Hardfork guards are correct

2. **EIP compliance** — Read the relevant EIPs/ and verify:
   - All MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements are implemented
   - Edge cases from the EIP are handled
   - Activation conditions are correct

3. **Nethermind architecture** — Read the equivalent Nethermind C# code:
   - Architecture matches Nethermind's structure
   - Module boundaries are consistent
   - Interface contracts match

4. **Ethereum test vectors** — Check that:
   - All relevant official test fixtures pass
   - No test-specific hacks or workarounds
   - Edge cases from test fixtures are covered

Flag ALL spec compliance issues. Be thorough — a single gas cost mismatch is a critical bug.

Severity levels:
- "critical" — Spec violation that would cause consensus failure
- "major" — Architectural deviation or missing spec requirement
- "minor" — Non-critical deviation (documentation, naming mismatch vs spec)
- "none" — Perfect spec compliance

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — You MUST end with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{'{'}
  "issues": ["Issue 1 description", "Issue 2 description"],
  "severity": "major",
  "feedback": "Overall spec compliance feedback",
  "specFilesChecked": ["execution-specs/path/file.py"]
{'}'}
```
Use severity "none" only if there are absolutely no spec compliance issues.
DO NOT skip the JSON output. The workflow will fail without it.
