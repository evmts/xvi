## Your Task

1. Verify each acceptance criterion is met
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Summarize what was accomplished
4. Note any struggles or lessons learned
5. Determine final status:
   - "complete" — All acceptance criteria met, all tests pass, reviews approved
   - "partial" — Some criteria met but work remains
   - "blocked" — Cannot proceed due to external dependency

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — You MUST end with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{'{'}
  "ticketId": "{props.ticketId}",
  "status": "complete",
  "summary": "What was accomplished",
  "filesChanged": ["path/to/file.zig"],
  "testsAdded": ["test description"],
  "reviewRounds": {props.reviewRounds},
  "struggles": "What was difficult (or null)",
  "lessonsLearned": "Insights for future tickets (or null)"
{'}'}
```
DO NOT skip the JSON output. The workflow will fail without it.
