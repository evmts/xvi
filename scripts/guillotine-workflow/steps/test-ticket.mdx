TESTING PHASE — Ticket: {props.ticketId}

Title: {props.ticketTitle}
Category: {props.ticketCategory}

Run ALL of the following test categories and report results:

Primary gate command for this repo:
- If category is `phase-3-evm-state`, run:
  `./scripts/guillotine-workflow/test-gates/phase-3-evm-state.sh`
  - Optional: set `RUN_PHASE3_SPEC_GATE=1` to include `zig build test` in the gate.
- Treat the script JSON summary as the source of truth for pass/fail.

1. UNIT TESTS:
   Run: zig build test
   Check that all inline tests pass for the files created/modified in this ticket.

2. SPEC TESTS (official Ethereum test vectors):
   Based on the category:
   - Phase 1 (trie): Run tests against ethereum-tests/TrieTests/
   - Phase 3 (evm-state): Use the phase-3 test gate script above
   - Phase 4 (blockchain): Run against ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/
   If no spec tests apply to this ticket yet, note "N/A" but still run unit tests.

3. INTEGRATION TESTS:
   If there are integration tests that test this module with previous modules, run them.

4. NETHERMIND DIFFERENTIAL TESTS:
   If applicable, verify our output matches Nethermind's for the same inputs.

If any tests fail and you need to fix code to make them pass, commit each fix atomically:
- git add the specific files, then commit
- Format: "🐛 fix(SCOPE): what was fixed"
- After committing, run: git pull --rebase origin main && git push

Report each category: passed or failed with details.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — You MUST end with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{'{'}
  "unitTestsPassed": true,
  "specTestsPassed": true,
  "integrationTestsPassed": true,
  "nethermindDiffPassed": true,
  "failingSummary": null,
  "testOutput": "Full test output summary"
{'}'}
```
DO NOT skip the JSON output. The workflow will fail without it.
