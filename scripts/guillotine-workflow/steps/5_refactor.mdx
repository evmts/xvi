REFACTORING PHASE: {props.phase}

Review all code written in this phase for:
1. Code duplication — extract shared logic
2. Naming consistency — match Zig conventions (snake_case functions, PascalCase types)
3. Public API surface — minimize what's public, keep internals private
4. Documentation — add /// doc comments to all public APIs
5. Import organization — clean up unused imports
6. Dead code — remove any unused functions or types
7. Consistent error handling patterns

Make improvements. Run zig fmt && zig build && zig build test after each change.
git commit each meaningful refactor separately.

If nothing needs refactoring, say so and move on.
