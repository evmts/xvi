CODE QUALITY REVIEW — Ticket: {props.ticketId}

Title: {props.ticketTitle}
Category: {props.ticketCategory}

You are reviewing this ticket's implementation for **code quality only**.
Spec compliance is reviewed separately — focus here on quality, correctness patterns, and maintainability.

## Files to Review

{props.filesCreated && props.filesCreated.length > 0 ? `Created:\n${props.filesCreated.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}` : ''}
{props.filesModified && props.filesModified.length > 0 ? `Modified:\n${props.filesModified.map(f => `- ${f}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Review Checklist

READ every file modified/created. Check:

1. **Error handling**
   - No catch {'{}'}  — EVER
   - No silent failures
   - All errors properly propagated with try
   - Error types are descriptive

2. **Voltaire usage**
   - Using Voltaire primitives everywhere (Address, Hash, u256, etc.)
   - Not reinventing types that Voltaire provides
   - Import paths are correct

3. **Code style**
   - zig fmt clean
   - snake_case for functions/variables
   - PascalCase for types
   - /// doc comments on public APIs
   - No unused imports or dead code

4. **Test coverage**
   - Every public function has inline tests
   - Edge cases are tested
   - Error conditions are tested
   - Tests are meaningful, not just smoke tests

5. **Performance**
   - Arena allocator used for transaction-scoped memory
   - No unnecessary heap allocations
   - No O(n²) where O(n) is possible
   - Proper use of comptime

6. **Architecture**
   - Comptime DI used properly (vtable pattern like HostInterface)
   - Module boundaries make sense
   - Public API surface is minimal

7. **Refactoring opportunities**
   - Code duplication that should be extracted
   - Naming improvements
   - Simplification opportunities

Severity levels:
- "critical" — Security issue, data corruption risk, or missing error handling
- "major" — Missing tests, architectural problems, or significant quality issues
- "minor" — Style issues, minor refactoring opportunities
- "none" — Code is production-quality

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — You MUST end with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{'{'}
  "issues": ["Issue 1 description", "Issue 2 description"],
  "severity": "major",
  "feedback": "Overall code quality feedback",
  "testCoverage": "Assessment of test coverage",
  "codeQuality": "Assessment of overall code quality"
{'}'}
```
Use severity "none" only if there are absolutely no quality issues.
DO NOT skip the JSON output. The workflow will fail without it.
