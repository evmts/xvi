REVIEW RESPONSE: {props.phase}

You are reviewing the fixes made in response to your previous code review.

ORIGINAL REVIEW FEEDBACK:
Severity: {props.originalSeverity}
Issues flagged: {JSON.stringify(props.originalIssues)}
Feedback: {props.originalFeedback}

FIXES APPLIED:
{JSON.stringify(props.fixesMade)}
Summary: {props.fixSummary}
Commit: {props.fixCommitMessage}

YOUR TASK:
1. Re-read the files that were modified
2. Verify each issue from your original review was properly addressed
3. Check that no new issues were introduced by the fixes

DECISION:
- Set fixesAccepted = true ONLY if ALL original issues were properly addressed
- Set fixesAccepted = false if ANY issue was not properly fixed or if new issues were introduced
- List any remaining or new issues in remainingIssues
- Provide specific feedback on what was done well and what still needs work

Be thorough but fair. If the fixes are correct, acknowledge it.

IMPORTANT: After reviewing the fixes, you MUST output a JSON object:
```json
{"{"}
  "fixesAccepted": true,
  "remainingIssues": [],
  "feedback": "Detailed feedback on whether the fixes addressed all original issues"
{"}"}
```
Set fixesAccepted to false and list any remaining issues if problems persist.
