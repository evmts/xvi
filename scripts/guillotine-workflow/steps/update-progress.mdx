UPDATE PROGRESS — Rewrite PROGRESS.md

Your job is to update PROGRESS.md with the current state of the project.

## Steps

1. Read the current PROGRESS.md
2. Read the git log for recent commits: `git log --oneline -50`
3. Browse the codebase to assess current state:
   - `ls client/` — check Zig client structure
   - `ls client-ts/` — check Effect client structure
   - Check test results if available
4. Rewrite PROGRESS.md with:
   - Updated completion percentages for each subsystem
   - Summary of recent work (from completed tickets)
   - Current gaps and priorities
   - Updated date/timestamp

{props.completedTickets && props.completedTickets.length > 0 ? `\nRecently completed tickets:\n${props.completedTickets.map(t => `- ${t}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Format

Keep the same general format as the existing PROGRESS.md:
- Table per client (Zig and Effect-TS)
- Columns: Phase, Subsystem, Completeness %, What's Done, What's Missing
- Overall summary at top and bottom
- Reference to shared EVM engine (Guillotine) and primitives (Voltaire)

## Commit

After updating:
```
git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "♻️ refactor(progress): update progress report"
git pull --rebase origin main && git push
```

**REQUIRED OUTPUT** — You MUST end with this exact JSON structure:
```json
{'{'}
  "progressFilePath": "PROGRESS.md",
  "summary": "Summary of current progress",
  "ticketsCompleted": ["ticket-id-1", "ticket-id-2"],
  "ticketsRemaining": ["ticket-id-3", "ticket-id-4"]
{'}'}
```
DO NOT skip the JSON output. The workflow will fail without it.
