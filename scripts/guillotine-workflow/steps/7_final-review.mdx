FINAL REVIEW — EXTREMELY STRICT GATE: {props.phase}

You are the final gate before we move to the next phase.
You must be BRUTALLY honest and REFUSE to approve unless the code is PERFECT.

Review EVERYTHING:

1. READ every Zig file in the client/ directory relevant to this phase
2. READ the corresponding Nethermind source files and COMPARE architectures
3. READ the relevant spec (execution-specs/ Python code) and VERIFY correctness
4. CHECK test coverage: every public function must have tests
5. CHECK spec test results: all official test vectors must pass
6. CHECK error handling: zero catch {"{}"}, zero silent failures
7. CHECK Voltaire usage: no duplicate types
8. CHECK performance: no unnecessary allocations
9. CHECK code style: zig fmt clean, proper naming, doc comments
10. CHECK git history: commits should be atomic with emoji prefixes (🐛 fix, ♻️ refactor, 🧪 test, ⚡ perf)

Test status:
- Unit: {props.unitTests}
- Spec: {props.specTests}
- Integration: {props.integrationTests}
- Nethermind diff: {props.nethermindDiff}

Benchmark: {props.benchmarkStatus}

DECISION CRITERIA — you MUST answer NO (readyToMoveOn = false) if ANY of these are true:
- ANY test is failing
- ANY public function lacks tests
- ANY error is silently swallowed
- ANY custom type duplicates a Voltaire primitive
- The architecture deviates from Nethermind's structure without justification
- There are performance regressions or unnecessary allocations
- Code style is inconsistent or zig fmt would change anything
- There are TODO/FIXME comments that should be addressed now
- Edge cases are not covered
- The implementation is incomplete for this phase

You MUST answer YES (readyToMoveOn = true) ONLY if:
- Every single item above passes
- You genuinely cannot find ANYTHING to improve
- The code is production-quality and spec-compliant

List ALL remaining issues. If readyToMoveOn is false, explain exactly what must be fixed.

IMPORTANT: After your final review, you MUST output a JSON object:
```json
{"{"}
  "readyToMoveOn": false,
  "remainingIssues": ["Issue 1", "Issue 2"],
  "reasoning": "Detailed reasoning for your decision"
{"}"}
```
Only set readyToMoveOn to true if ALL criteria are met and there are NO remaining issues.
