TESTING PHASE: {props.phase}

Run ALL of the following test categories and report results:

Primary gate command for this repo:
- If phase is `phase-3-evm-state`, run:
  `./scripts/guillotine-workflow/test-gates/phase-3-evm-state.sh`
  - Optional: set `RUN_PHASE3_SPEC_GATE=1` to include `zig build test` in the gate.
- Treat the script JSON summary as the source of truth for pass/fail.

1. UNIT TESTS:
   Run: zig build test
   Check that all inline tests pass for the files we just created/modified.

2. SPEC TESTS (official Ethereum test vectors):
   Based on the phase:
   - Phase 1 (trie): Run tests against ethereum-tests/TrieTests/
   - Phase 3 (evm-state): Use the phase-3 test gate script above (or run `RUN_PHASE3_SPEC_GATE=1 ./scripts/guillotine-workflow/test-gates/phase-3-evm-state.sh`)
   - Phase 4 (blockchain): Run against ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/
   If no spec tests apply to this phase yet, note "N/A" but still run unit tests.

3. INTEGRATION TESTS:
   If there are integration tests that test this module with previous modules, run them.

4. NETHERMIND DIFFERENTIAL TESTS:
   If applicable, verify our output matches Nethermind's for the same inputs.
   For trie: same inserts → same root hash
   For state: same tx → same post-state root
   For block processing: same block → same receipts root

If any tests fail and you need to fix code to make them pass, commit each fix atomically:
- git add the specific files, then commit
- Format: "🐛 fix(SCOPE): what was fixed"
- Example: "🐛 fix(phase-0-db): correct batch write ordering"

If you add new test files, commit them:
- Format: "🧪 test(SCOPE): what was tested"
- Example: "🧪 test(phase-0-db): add edge case tests for iterator"

Report each category: passed or failed with details.
If any tests fail, provide a clear summary of what's failing and why.

IMPORTANT: After running all tests, you MUST output a JSON object:
```json
{"{"}
  "unitTestsPassed": true,
  "specTestsPassed": true,
  "integrationTestsPassed": true,
  "nethermindDiffPassed": true,
  "failingSummary": null,
  "testOutput": "Full test output summary"
{"}"}
```
Set boolean values to true/false based on test results. If any tests fail, put a summary of failures in failingSummary.
