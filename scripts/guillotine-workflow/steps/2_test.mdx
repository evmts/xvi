TESTING PHASE: {props.phase}

Run ALL of the following test categories and report results:

1. UNIT TESTS:
   Run: zig build test
   Check that all inline tests pass for the files we just created/modified.

2. SPEC TESTS (official Ethereum test vectors):
   Based on the phase:
   - Phase 1 (trie): Run tests against ethereum-tests/TrieTests/
   - Phase 3 (evm-state): Run against ethereum-tests/GeneralStateTests/ and execution-spec-tests fixtures
   - Phase 4 (blockchain): Run against ethereum-tests/BlockchainTests/
   If no spec tests apply to this phase yet, note "N/A" but still run unit tests.

3. INTEGRATION TESTS:
   If there are integration tests that test this module with previous modules, run them.

4. NETHERMIND DIFFERENTIAL TESTS:
   If applicable, verify our output matches Nethermind's for the same inputs.
   For trie: same inserts → same root hash
   For state: same tx → same post-state root
   For block processing: same block → same receipts root

Report each category: passed or failed with details.
If any tests fail, provide a clear summary of what's failing and why.
