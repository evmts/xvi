CODEBASE REVIEW — {props.categoryId}: {props.categoryName}

You are reviewing the existing implementation of **{props.categoryName}** ({props.categoryId}).
This is a thorough audit of past work — NOT new feature development.

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Spec Compliance
- Read the relevant execution-specs/ Python code for this category
- Read the relevant EIPs
- Compare our implementation line-by-line against the authoritative specs
- Flag ANY deviations, missing features, or incorrect behavior
- Gas costs must match exactly
- State transitions must match exactly
- Error conditions must match exactly

### 2. Nethermind Architecture
- Read the equivalent Nethermind C# code in nethermind/src/Nethermind/
- Compare our module boundaries, interfaces, and patterns
- Flag architectural deviations that aren't justified
- Check that our DI patterns match Nethermind's module structure

### 3. Test Coverage
- Check if every public function has inline tests
- Check if official Ethereum test fixtures are being used (ethereum-tests/, execution-spec-tests/)
- Check if edge cases are covered (empty inputs, max values, overflow, zero gas)
- Run relevant test suites: `zig build test`
- Report any failures

### 4. Code Quality
- Check error handling: no `catch {'{}'}`, no silent failures, all errors propagated with `try`
- Check code style: `zig fmt` clean, snake_case functions, PascalCase types, `///` doc comments
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments that should be addressed
- Check for dead code, unused imports
- Check for performance issues (unnecessary allocations, O(n²) where O(n) is possible)

### 5. Voltaire Integration
- Verify we use Voltaire primitives everywhere (Address, Hash, u256, RLP, etc.)
- Check we're not reinventing types that Voltaire provides
- Verify import paths are correct: `@import("primitives")`, `@import("crypto")`

## Integration Test Status

Read `docs/test-suite-findings.md` if it exists — this contains the status of external test suites for each category, what's blocking them, and suggested tickets to unblock testing. Use this to inform your review of test coverage gaps.

## Where to Look

Browse `client/` for files related to this category.
Read the relevant files thoroughly — don't just skim.

{props.relevantDirs ? `\nHint directories:\n${props.relevantDirs.map(d => `- ${d}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Generate Review Tickets

For each substantive issue found, generate a review ticket in the `suggestedTickets` array.
Each ticket should be actionable and specific — not "improve error handling" but "add error propagation to DbAdapter.get() which currently uses catch {'{}'}".

GIT RULES — CRITICAL:
- Do NOT make any commits during this review
- This is a read-only analysis phase
