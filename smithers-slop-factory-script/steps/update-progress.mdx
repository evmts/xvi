UPDATE PROGRESS — Rewrite PROGRESS.md

Your job is to update PROGRESS.md with the current state of the project.

## CRITICAL: This is a READ-ONLY assessment step

Do NOT run any build commands, test commands, or compilation. No `zig build`, `zig build test`, `zig build specs`, `bun test`, or similar. Those are expensive and handled by dedicated test/spec steps in the pipeline. You only read code, git history, and existing output files.

## Steps

1. Read the current PROGRESS.md
2. Read the git log for recent commits: `git log --oneline -50`
3. Read existing output from other pipeline steps:
   - `docs/test-suite-findings.md` — integration test status per category (written by the IntegrationTest step)
   - `docs/context/*.md` — research context files (written by Research steps)
   - `docs/plans/*.md` — implementation plans (written by Plan steps)
4. Browse the codebase to assess current state:
   - `ls client/` — check Zig client structure
   - `ls client-ts/` — check Effect client structure
   - Read source files to gauge completeness (do NOT compile or run tests)
5. Rewrite PROGRESS.md with:
   - Updated completion percentages for each subsystem
   - Summary of recent work (from completed tickets and git log)
   - Test status (from docs/test-suite-findings.md, NOT from running tests)
   - Current gaps and priorities
   - Updated date/timestamp

{props.completedTickets && props.completedTickets.length > 0 ? `\nRecently completed tickets:\n${props.completedTickets.map(t => `- ${t}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Format

Keep the same general format as the existing PROGRESS.md:
- Table per client (Zig and Effect-TS)
- Columns: Phase, Subsystem, Completeness %, What's Done, What's Missing
- Overall summary at top and bottom
- Reference to shared EVM engine (Guillotine) and primitives (Voltaire)

## Commit

After updating:
```
git add PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "♻️ refactor(progress): update progress report"
git pull --rebase origin main && git push
```
